# CS251-Project-2-Search
**Author**: Joe Wu <br>
**Goal**: Search is a C++ program written in VScode that preprocess the body text of a URL and store it in an appropriate data structure for fast query and retrieval. The URLs and other files are included in the program, but a user can import their own.<br><br>

##### Implementation Instructions 
For descriptions of what the functions in the code do, in the include folder, there is the file search.h that explains the functions used in building a reversed index, matching searches to user queries, and more.<br><br>
